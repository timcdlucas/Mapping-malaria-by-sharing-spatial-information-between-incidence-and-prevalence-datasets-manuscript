Elimination of malaria, country-by-county has become a central goal in the global malaria strategy \cite{wmr2016}.

\section*{Introduction}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Global malaria incidence has decreased dramatically over the last 20 years \cite{gbd2017}.
This has been accompanied by a strategic shift towards aiming for elimination in low burden countries \cite{wmr?}.
Accurate, high-resolution maps of malaria risk are vital in these countries in the elimination and pre-elimination phases \cite{Gething map op-ed?}.
However, mapping malaria in low burden countries presents new challenges as traditional mapping of prevalence using cluster-level surveys and model-based geostatistics are not necessarily effective in these areas \cite {Gething op-ed, sturrock}.
In low burden areas, very large sample sizes are needed before a prevalence survey is informative.
Furthermore, large, countrywide surveys of prevalence, such as DHS or MIS, are rare in low burden countries due to costs and percieved low utility \cite{dunno}.
We therefore need new data sources and associated statistical methods.

Routine surveillance data, of disease case counts, is becoming more widely available and of better quality.
This data is commonly aggregated, reporting disease case counts that occurred within a certain geographic region defined by a polygon.
This type of data is more sensitive than prevalence surveys in low transmission areas as three entire health system is being used to passively monitor disease risk.
Routine surveillance is also often timely, with reports being released annually or monthly, while large prevalence surveys are performed on a more decadely time scale.
However, the unstructured nature of the data collection means that dealing with biases and data gaps is an ongoing research priority \cite{battlets, cibulski}.

%however surveillance data is sometimes high quality in these areas
%pixel level maps from aggregates data is difficult (sturrock, inla, Leon, others)
%not much information for covariates 
sturrock used two.
%undeveloped area of statistics but see Leon.

Furthermore, using aggregated data to estimate malaria risk for high resolution maps presents further modelling difficulties \cite{sturrock, inla, Leon, others}.
The aggregated nature of the data means that each data point does not necessarily contain much information, especially if the case counts are aggregated over a large or heterogenous area.
For example, \cite{sturrock} use only two covariates do to the lack of information in their data.

A model that could combine point surveys and aggregated surveillance has great potential if it could leverage the strengths of both aggregated surveillance data and point survey data.
One major barrier to this modelling approved us that these two data sources are on different scales: point surveys are a measurement of prevalence $\lbrack 0, 1\rbrack$ while routine surveillance measures incidence $\lbrack 0, \infty\rbrack$.
One approach to combining these datasets is to use a seperately estimated model that maps one scale to another such as \cite{cameron2015}.

%Ideal situation is to combine data
benefits of both
%but data are on different scales
%Ewan says there's a relationship.

Here we formulate a joint model that combines aggregated surveillance data and point prevalence surveys of \emph{Plasmodium falciparum}.
We compare the joint model to models fitted with only one type of data.
As case studies we use three countries with good routine surveillance data as well as good coverage of prevalence point surveys.


%here we compared 3 models, point only, polygon only and joint models
%we use Madagascar and Indonesia as case studies as they have good %surveillance data and good pr data.
we find that...

\section*{Materials and methods}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


\subsection*{Malaria data}

We used two data sources that reflect malaria burden; point prevalence surveys and polygon-level, aggregated incidence data.
We selected Madagascar and Indonesia as case examples as they have both good surveillance data and good country wide surveys from approximately the same time.
Given the available data we chose to focus our analysis on 2012-2015 for Indonesia and 2013-2014 for Madagascar.

\subsection*{Prevalence survey data}

The prevalence survey data were extracted from the MAP prevalence survey database \cite{}.
As the prevalence surveys cover different are ranges they were standardised using the model from \cite{}.

\subsection*{Polygon incidence data}


\subsection*{Population data}

\subsection*{Covariate data}

We considered an initial suite of environmental and anthropological covariates, at a resolution of approximately $5 \times 5$ kilometres that included land surface temperature annual mean and standard deviation, enhanced vegetation index, mosquito temperature suitability index, elevation, tassel cap brightness, tassel cap wetness, accessibility to cities, night lights and proportion of urban land cover.
Elevation, land surface temperature standard deviation, accessibility to cities and night lights were all log transformed to reduce skewness.
After preliminary analyses, tassel cap brightness and urban land cover were removed as they were highly correlated with other variables.
The covariates are standardised to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one.

\subsection*{The model}

We compared three models 1) a full model with prevalence surveys and aggregated incidence data 2) the submodel with only prevalence data and 3) the submodel with only aggregated incidence data.

The full, joint likelihood model is described as follows. 
Values at the aggregate, polygon level are given the subscript $a$ while pixel or point level below are indexed with $b$.
The polygon case count data, $y_j$ is given a Poisson likelihood

$$y_a \sim \operatorname{Pois}(i_a\mathrm{pop_a})$$

where $i_a$ is the estimated polygon incidence rate and $\mathrm{pop_a}$ is the observed polygon population-at-risk.

The point-level prevalence data, $z_b$, is given a binomial likelihood

$$z_b \sim \operatorname{Binom}(p_b, n_b) $$

where $p_b$ is the estimated prevalence and $n_b$ is the observed survey sample size. 

The two quantities are linked to each other and to the predictor variables by the following system of equations.

$$i_a = \frac{ \sum(i_b \mathrm{pop}_b)}{\sum  \mathrm{pop}_b} $$

$$i_b = \mathrm{p2i}(p_b)$$

where $\mathrm{p2i}$ is from a model that was published previously. \cite{cameron2015defining}
After fitting, this model defines a function
$$\mathrm{p2i}: f\left(P\right) = 2.616P - 3.596P^2 + 1.594P^3$$.

The linear predictor of the model, $\eta_b$, is related to prevalence by a typical logit link function.

$$p_b = \operatorname{logit}^{-1}(\eta_b)$$


The form of the link function means we get predictions of prevalence and incidence simultaneously whether we used both data types or just one.
The linear predictor is composed of an intercept, covariates a spatial, Gaussian random field two iid random effects.

$$\eta_b = \beta_0 + \beta X  + u(s, \rho, \sigma_u) + v_j(\sigma_v) + w_i(\sigma_w)$$

The Gaussian spatial effect $u(s, \rho, \sigma_u)$ has a Mat\'ern covariance function and two hyper parameters: $\rho$, the nominal range (beyond which correlation is $< 0.1$) and $\sigma_u$, the marginal standard deviation.
The first iid random effect, $v_j \sim \operatorname{Norm}(0, \sigma_v)$,  was grouped by polygon, with all pixels and point surveys within polygon $j$ being grouped together.
This random effect modelled both missing covariates and extra-Poisson sampling error. 
The second iid random effect, $w_i \sim \operatorname{Norm}(0, \sigma_w)$, was applied to each point survey.
This effect modelled extra-binomial sampling noise.
As such, this random effect is not included in the predicted uncertainty in the incidence or prevalence layers.
However, it is included in predictions of out-of-sample point surveys.

Finally, we complete the model by setting priors on the parameters $\beta_0, \beta, \rho$ and $\sigma_u$, $\sigma_v$ and $\sigma_w$.
We assigned $\rho$ and $\sigma_u$ a joint penalised complexity prior \ref{notSimpson} such that $P(\rho < 3) = 0.00001$ and $P(\sigma_u > 1) = 0.00001$.
We believe that a large proportion of the variance of malaria prevalence and incidence cannot be explained by a linear combination of the covariates selected, so we set this prior such that the randome field could explain most of the range of the data.

We assigned $\sigma_v$ a penalised complexity prior such that $P(\sigma_v > 0.05) = 0.0000001$
This was based on a comparison of the variance of Poisson random variables, with rates given by the number of cases observed, and an independently derived upper and lower bound for three case counts \ref{cibulskis}.
We found that an iid effect with a standard deviation of 0.05 would be able to account for the discrepancy between the assumed Poisson error and the independently derived error.
We assigned $\sigma_w$ a penalised complexity prior such that $P(\sigma_w > 0.3) = 0.0000001$. 
This was chosen by finding the maximum difference in prevalence between survey points (with a sample size greater than 500) within the same raster pixel.
The differences between points within the same pixel can only be accounted for by the binomial error and this iid effect.
Given that the error on a prevalence estimate with sample size greater than 500 is quite small, the iid effect needs to be able to explain this difference.

Finally, we set regularising priors on the regression coefficients $\beta_i \sim \operatorname{ Norm}(0, 0.04)$. 
Given the standardised covariates, a regression coefficient from the 95\% IQR of this distribution, and an intercept of 3, I've covariate would be able to predict prevalences between 0.004 and 0.27. 
This prior encodes our belief that the full range of malaria transmission can not be explained by a single covariate and our desire to regularised our model.


\subsection*{Experiments}

To compare the three models we used two cross validation schemes. 
In the first, the combined data set of prevalence and incidence data was split into five cross-validation folds stratified by data type.
This reflects real world data where we sometimes have incidence data but no prevalence data and visa versa.
Thus this cross-validation scheme can be seen as asking whether aggregated incidence data provides a viable or preferable alternative to using just prevalence data as in previous modelling efforts \cite{bhatt2016nature}.

In the second validation scheme the data was split into five spatial cross-validation folds (see Figure~\ref{fig:data}b).
The data was divided by combining the point locations and the centroids of the polygons and performing k means clustering.
This scheme is testing the models' ability to predict into new areas with little information from the spatial random field.

In both cases we examined performance metrics for both the withheld prevalence data and the withheld incidence data.
As there is no good way of combining predictive error from both types of data into one performance metric, we considered performance separately throughout.
Our main performance metric was Pearson's correlation.
However, we also considered Spearman's correlation.
If the prevalence-incidence relationship is poorly estimated, this will strongly affect the Pearson's correlation while the Spearman's correlation will be relatively robust to this source of poor model performance.
