\section*{Introduction}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Global malaria incidence has decreased dramatically over the last 20 years \cite{abajobir2017global, bhatt2015effect}.
This decrease has been accompanied by a strategic shift towards aiming for elimination in low incidence countries \cite{world2016world, newby2016path}.
Accurate, high-resolution maps of malaria risk are vital in countries in the elimination and pre-elimination phases \cite{sturrock2016mapping, cohen2017mapping}.
However, mapping malaria in low burden countries presents new challenges as traditional mapping of prevalence \cite{gething2011new, bhatt2017improved, gething2012long} using cluster-level surveys and model-based geostatistics are not necessarily effective in these areas \cite {sturrock2016mapping, sturrock2014fine}.
In low burden areas, very large sample sizes are needed before a prevalence survey is informative.
Furthermore, large, countrywide surveys of prevalence, such as DHS or MIS, are rare in low burden countries due to costs and percieved low utility \cite{dhs}.
We therefore need new data sources and associated statistical methods.

%Despite major reductions in incidence over the last fifteen years, malaria still causes millions of deaths and loads of DALYs annually \cite{abajobir2017global}.
%Elimination of malaria, country-by-county has become a central goal in the global malaria strategy \cite{world2016world}.
%Elimination of malaria requires high resolution maps of malaria risk, in low prevalence areas in order to optimise interventions and minimise costs \cite{sturrock2016mapping}.

%cohen2017mapping Different metrics are useful for different things. Most maps use prevalence. Govts do use maps.

Routine surveillance data, of malaria case counts, is becoming more widely available and of better quality \cite{sturrock2016mapping, ohrt2015information, cibulskis2011worldwide}.
Surveillance data is commonly aggregated, reporting the number of cases that occurred within a certain geographic or administrative region defined by a polygon.
Ths surveillance data can be more sensitive than prevalence surveys in low transmission areas as the entire public health system is being used to passively monitor disease risk \cite{cibulskis2011worldwide}.
Furthermore, surveillance data is also often timely, with reports being released annually or monthly, while large prevalence surveys are performed on a more decadely time scale.
However, the unstructured nature of data collection and reporting from national disease surveillance systems means that dealing with biases and data gaps is an ongoing research priority \cite{battle2016treatment, cibulskis2011worldwide}.

%however surveillance data is sometimes high quality in these areas
%pixel level maps from aggregates data is difficult (sturrock2014fine, wilson2017pointless, law2018variational, others)
%not much information for covariates 
%sturrock used two.
%undeveloped area of statistics but see Leon.

Further to issues with the data itself, using aggregated data to estimate malaria risk for high resolution maps presents particular modelling difficulties \cite{sturrock2014fine, wilson2017pointless, law2018variational, taylor2017continuous, li2012log}.
%Disaggregation models aim to estimate high-resolution maps from aggregated data and are characterised by having a variable number of pixels, and therefore multiple rows of covariate data, per row of response data.
The aggregating of cases over space means that the data may be relatively uninformative, especially if the case counts are aggregated over a large or heterogenous area.
For example, Sturrock \emph{et al.} used only two environmental covariates in their model \cite{sturrock2014fine}.
Disaggregation models are also simply an underrepresented class of models in the statistical literature and statistical software.
Wilson \emph{et al.} \cite{wilson2017pointless} used an approximation to represent a downscaling model as a convolution matrix within R-INLA \cite{INLA} but more generally, downscaling models are not available in popular software packages and must be programmed explicitely.
Furthermore, disaggregation models are relatively difficult to implement as they have more rows of covariate data than response data.


A model that combines point surveys and aggregated surveillance data, and therefore leverages the strength of both, has great potential.
Joint modelling of the two data types has the potential to increase statistical power for learning relationships between malaria risk and covariates both by simply making more data available and because the point survey has a one-to-one relationship with the environment at the location of the survey.
Furthermore, using two complimentary datasets potentially allows better spatial coverage. 
One major barrier to this modelling approach is that these two data sources are on different scales: point surveys are a measurement of prevalence in the range $\lbrack 0, 1\rbrack$ while routine surveillance measures incidence in the range $\lbrack 0, \infty\rbrack$.
One approach to combining these datasets is to use a seperately estimated model that maps one scale to another such as \cite{cameron2015defining}.

%Ideal situation is to combine data
%benefits of both
%but data are on different scales
%Ewan says there's a relationship.

Here we formulate a joint model that combines aggregated surveillance data and point prevalence-surveys of \emph{Plasmodium falciparum}.
The model has seperate likelihoods for the two data types.
We relate the two malariometric measures by using a previously estimated relationship within the model \cite{cameron2015defining}.
We compare the joint model to two benchmark models, a prevalence-survey only model and an aggregated-incidence disaggregation model similar to previous models \cite{sturrock2014fine, wilson2017pointless}.
As case studies we use data from Indonesia, Senegal and Madagascar as these countries have both good routine surveillance data and good coverage of prevalence point surveys.


%here we compared 3 models, point only, polygon only and joint models

\section*{Materials and methods}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


\subsection*{Malaria data}

We used two data sources that reflect malaria burden; point prevalence surveys and polygon-level, aggregated incidence data.
We selected Indonesia, Senegal and Madagascar as case examples as they all have good surveillance data and good country wide surveys from approximately the same time.
To minimise temporal effects we select, for each country, one year of prevalence survey data and one year of surveillance data.
For Indonesia we selected 2012 for surveillance data (380 regions) and 2010 for  prevalence data (969 surveys, 128537 individuals).
For Senegal we selected 2015 for both surveillance data (46 regions) and prevalence data (216 surveys, 8114). % update todo
Finally, for Madagascar we selected 2013 for both surveillance (110 regions) and prevalence (290 surveys, 7244 individuals) data.



\subsection*{Prevalence survey data}

The prevalence survey data were extracted from the Malaria Atlas Project prevalence survey database \cite{bhatt2015effect}.
As the prevalence surveys cover different age ranges they were standardised using the model from \cite{smith2007standardizing}.


\subsection*{Polygon incidence data}

The polygon level surveillance data were collated from various government reports (Figures~\ref{predobsmapidn}A and \ref{predobsmapsen}A).
To account for underreporting of clinical cases due to lack of treatment seeking, missed case reports and cases that sought medical attention outside the public health systems, the methods in \cite{cibulskis2011worldwide} were used using estimates of treatment seeking from \cite{battle2016treatment}.
Where species specific reports were given, these were used. 
For reports where no species specific, national estimates of the ratio between \emph{P. falciparum} and \emph{P. vivax} cases were used to calculate \emph{P. falciparum} only cases.



\subsection*{Population data}

Raster surfaces of population for the years 2005, 2010 and 2015, were created using a hybrid of data from GPWv4 \cite{gpw4} and WorldPop \cite{tatem2017worldpop}, with the latter taking priority for those pixels where both had population data. 
Final population rasters were created by linear interpolation of the surrounding five-yearly rasters.
Finally, for each year, national population estimates from the UN were raked over the interpolated population surfaces. 

\subsection*{Covariate data}

We considered an initial suite of environmental and anthropological covariates, at a resolution of approximately $5 \times 5$ kilometres at the equator that included land surface temperature annual mean and standard deviation \cite{LST}, enhanced vegetation index \cite{TCB}, mosquito temperature suitability index \cite{weiss2014air}, elevation \cite{SRTMElev}, tassel cap brightness \cite{TCB}, tassel cap wetness \cite{TCB}, accessibility to cities \cite{weiss2018global}, night lights \cite{} and proportion of urban land cover \cite{}.
Elevation, land surface temperature standard deviation, accessibility to cities and night lights were all log transformed to reduce skewness.
After preliminary analyses, tassel cap brightness and urban land cover were removed as they were highly correlated with other variables.
The covariates were standardised to have a mean of zero and a standard deviation of one.

\subsection*{The model}

We compared three models 1) a full model with prevalence surveys and aggregated incidence data 2) the submodel with only prevalence data and 3) the submodel with only aggregated incidence data. 
The models were implemented and fitted using Template Model Builder \cite{TMB} in R \cite{R}

The full, joint likelihood model is described as follows. 
Values at the aggregate, polygon level are given the subscript $a$ while pixel or point level below are indexed with $b$.
The polygon case count data, $y_j$ is given a Poisson likelihood

$$y_a \sim \operatorname{Pois}(i_a\mathrm{pop_a})$$

where $i_a$ is the estimated polygon incidence rate and $\mathrm{pop_a}$ is the observed polygon population-at-risk.

The point-level prevalence data, $z_b$, is given a binomial likelihood

$$z_b \sim \operatorname{Binom}(p_b, n_b) $$

where $p_b$ is the estimated prevalence and $n_b$ is the observed survey sample size. 

The two quantities are linked to each other and to the predictor variables by the following system of equations.

$$i_a = \frac{ \sum(i_b \mathrm{pop}_b)}{\sum  \mathrm{pop}_b} $$

$$i_b = \mathrm{p2i}(p_b)$$

where $\mathrm{p2i}$ is a function from a previously fitted model \cite{cameron2015defining} 
$$\mathrm{p2i}: f\left(P\right) = 2.616P - 3.596P^2 + 1.594P^3.$$

The linear predictor of the model, $\eta_b$, is related to prevalence by a typical logit link function.

$$p_b = \operatorname{logit}^{-1}(\eta_b)$$


The form of the link function means we get predictions of prevalence and incidence simultaneously whether we used both data types or just one.
The linear predictor is composed of an intercept, covariates, a spatial, Gaussian random field and two iid random effects.

$$\eta_b = \beta_0 + \beta X  + u(s, \rho, \sigma_u) + v_j(\sigma_v) + w_i(\sigma_w)$$

The Gaussian spatial effect $u(s, \rho, \sigma_u)$ has a Mat\'ern covariance function and two hyper parameters: $\rho$, the nominal range (beyond which correlation is $< 0.1$) and $\sigma_u$, the marginal standard deviation.
The first iid random effect, $v_j \sim \operatorname{Norm}(0, \sigma_v)$,  was grouped by polygon, with all pixels and point surveys within polygon $j$ being grouped together.
This random effect modelled both missing covariates and extra-Poisson sampling error. 
The second iid random effect, $w_i \sim \operatorname{Norm}(0, \sigma_w)$, was applied to each point survey.
This effect modelled extra-binomial sampling noise.
As such, this random effect is not included in the predicted uncertainty in the incidence or prevalence layers.
However, it is included in predictions of out-of-sample point surveys.

Finally, we complete the model by setting priors on the parameters $\beta_0, \beta, \rho$ and $\sigma_u$, $\sigma_v$ and $\sigma_w$.
We assigned $\rho$ and $\sigma_u$ a joint penalised complexity prior \cite{fuglstad2018constructing} such that $P(\rho < \zeta) = 0.00001$ and $P(\sigma_u > 1) = 0.00001$.
We used different $\zeta$ values for each country: Indonesia $\zeta = 3$, Senegal $\zeta = 1$ and Madagascar $\zeta = 1$.
We believe that a large proportion of the variance of malaria prevalence and incidence cannot be explained by a linear combination of the covariates selected \cite{bhatt2017improved}, so we set this prior such that the random field could explain most of the range of the data.

We assigned $\sigma_v$ a penalised complexity prior \cite{simpson2017penalising} such that $P(\sigma_v > 0.05) = 0.0000001$
This was based on a comparison of the variance of Poisson random variables, with rates given by the number of cases observed, and an independently derived upper and lower bound for the case counts using the approach defined in \cite{cibulskis2011worldwide}.
We found that an iid effect with a standard deviation of 0.05 would be able to account for the discrepancy between the assumed Poisson error and the independently derived error.
We assigned $\sigma_w$ a penalised complexity prior such that $P(\sigma_w > 0.3) = 0.0000001$. 
This was chosen by finding the maximum difference in prevalence between survey points (with a sample size greater than 500) within the same raster pixel.
The differences between points within the same pixel can only be accounted for by the binomial error and this iid effect.
Given that the error on a prevalence estimate with sample size greater than 500 is quite small, the iid effect needs to be able to explain this difference.

Finally, we set regularising priors on the regression coefficients $\beta_i \sim \operatorname{Norm}(0, 0.04)$. 
Given the standardised covariates, a regression coefficient from the 95\% IQR of this distribution, and an intercept of 3, each covariate would be able to predict prevalences between 0.004 and 0.27. 
This prior encodes our belief that the full range of malaria transmission can not be explained by a single covariate and our desire to regularised our model.



\subsection*{Experiments}

To compare the three models we used two cross validation schemes. 
In the first, the combined data set of prevalence and incidence data was split into ten cross-validation folds stratified by data type (Figure~\ref{fig:cv_random}).
This reflects real world data where we in some locations we have incidence data but no prevalence data and visa versa.
Thus this cross-validation scheme can be seen as asking whether aggregated incidence data provides a viable or preferable alternative to using just prevalence data as in previous modelling efforts \cite{bhatt2015effect}.

\label{fig:cv_spatial}
\end{figure}



In the second validation scheme the data was split into spatial cross-validation folds (see Figure~\ref{fig:cv_spatial}).
The number of folds was seven for Indonesia, four for Senegal and three for Madagascar due to their differing sizes and geographies.
The data was divided by combining the point locations and the centroids of the incidence polygons and performing k means clustering.
This scheme is testing the models' ability to predict into new areas with little information from the spatial random field.

In both cases we examined performance metrics for both the withheld prevalence data and the withheld incidence data.
As there is no good way of combining predictive error from both types of data into one performance metric, we considered performance separately throughout.
Our main performance metric was mean absolute error (MAE) for incidence and MAE weighted by survey sample size for prevalence.
While other metrics could have been used, we specifically did not use correlation as correlation measures linear dependance without regard to slope or intercept.
As the models are being fitted on data on difference scales we found that predictions were sometimes correlated but strongly displaced from the one-one line and therefore correlation metrics were misleading.
% Why not correlation
To assess how well the models were calibrated we considered coverage of the 80\% predictive credible intervals on the hold-out data.

For the random cross-validation experiments, the polygon-only model had the lowest mean absolute error, with respect to predicting incidence, for Indonesia (14.02) and Senegal (26.74) (Table~\ref{table1}).
Incidence in Madagascar was best predicted by the join model (34.49).
However, the difference between the two models in Indonesia was small (polygons-only 14.02, joint model 14.09).
Scatter plots of the out-of-sample predictions can be seen in Figures~\ref{randompredobsscatter}A, C and E.

The benchmark points-only model had the lowest weighted MAE between observed and predicted prevalence for both Senegal (0.015) and  Madagascar (0.054) while the wighted MAE was the same for all three models in Indonesia (0.010) (Table~\ref{table1}).
The more pertinent comparison is whether the addition of the prevalence data improves the ability of the disaggregation models to predict pixel level prevalence.
However, weighted MAE was unchanged between the polygon model and the joint model for Indonesia (0.010), Senegal (0.024) or Madagascar (0.059).
Scatter plots of the out-of-sample predictions can be seen in Figures~\ref{randompredobsscatter} B, D and F and show poor predictive performance for all models in both Indonesia and Senegal.

Maps of the Indonesian input data and predictions (Figures~\ref{predobsmapidn}A and B) indicate that the broad spatial patterns of malaria incidence were recovered with areas in Papua, Borneo and Suluwasi being estimated as relatively high risk.
Similarly, input data and predictions (Figures~\ref{predobsmapsen}A and B) for Senegal show broad agreement with malaria incidence being higher in the South.

For the spatial cross-validation experiments, the polygon-only model again had the lowest mean absolute error between observed and predicted incidence for Indonesia (14.77) (Table~\ref{table2}).
However, for both Senegal (36.76) and Madagascar (65.50) the joint model had the best predictive performance.
Scatter plots of the out-of-sample predictions can be seen in Figures~\ref{spatialpredobsscatter}A, C and E.

Again, the benchmark points-only model had the lowest weighted MAE between spatially cross-validated observed and predicted prevalence for Senegal (0.015).
However, for Indonesia, both the disaggration models marginally outperformed the points-only model (polygons-only 0.010, joint model 0.010). 
For Senegal, the joint model (0.065) had the lowest weighted MAE for predicted prevalence though this was again marginal (points-only 0.069, polygons-only 0.066).
Scatter plots of the out-of-sample predictions can be seen in Figures~\ref{randompredobsscatter} B, D and F and show poor predictive performance for all models in both Indonesia and Senegal.

Maps of the Indonesian input data and spatially out-of-sample predictions (Figures~\ref{predobsmapidn}A and C) suggest the that the broad spatial patterns were once again recovered.
This acceptable performance is notable given the very large areas held out-of-sample (Fig~\ref{fig:cv_spatial}).
For example, the whole of Papua and West Papua the the East are held out in a single fold.
In contrast the predictions for Senegal do not match those observed in the input data (Figures~\ref{predobsmapsen}A and C). 


% Coverage results

The polygon-only model and the joint model seem to be fairly well calibrated.
The proportion of out-of-sample incidence datapoints being within their 80\% credible intervals ranged between 0.65 and 0.85.
The proportion of out-of-sample prevalence datapoints being within their 80\% credible intervals ranged from 0.50 to 0.96.
The points only model was reasonably well calibrated for predictions of prevalence (coverage ranging from 0.8 to 0.93) but was poorly calibrated for predicting incidence with coverage values as low as 0.11 and the best coverage value being 0.68 for spatial crossvalidation in Madagascar.
